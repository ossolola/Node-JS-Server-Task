    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        I am a graduate of Mathematics and I started my tech journey 3 years ago, that was before I graduated college. <br>
        I didn't do web development until a couple of months ago and the journey has been a bit tough but interesting. <br>
        I started off with HTML and CSS, I'm presently on JavaScript and I am taking a course on Node-JS alongside. <br>
